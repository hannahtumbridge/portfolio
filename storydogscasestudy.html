        <p>A practical team project with 3 other members of the UX/UI Bootcamp I attended - focusing on a User Interface Design “uplift” for a local non-for-profit organization.  My team and I selected Story Dogs, an Australian NFP focused on improving the literacy skills of all children.

          <br>
          From this we could extract several key elements that we felt like we could achieve within our time available for this project.  These were:

    <p>Our group approached our uplift project as a multi-step process.  The main focus was to achieve a worthy update to the site within our current timeframe of 3 weeks.  We broke down our process into 5 stages - Research, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test, however our flow through these stages wasn’t necessarily linear.  
      <br>
      <br>
      Whilst we did start with researching the User’s that we involved in the site and performing a heuristic evaluation -  we also focused on pulling together a style guide from their current social media branding or some beginning wireframes that were based off our competitor analysis.  
      <br>
      <br>
      Working in a team meant that we could sub-divide the work across multiple fronts and move quickly through it to ensure that we met our deadline and ensure that we didn't experience too much scope creep.

    <br>
    <p>Reaching out to the team at Story Dogs and gaining their insight that helped bring our uplift project to another level.  Through several correspondences we discussed elements of their volunteers, their goals, sponsorship deals and how they wanted to grow in the future.  Due to the timeframe we knew we wouldn't be able to achieve all of the goals they had but focused on these major ones:</p> 
    <div class="tags">
      <div class="tag">
        <p>We would like the redesign to show how our organization has <span class = "bold"> impacted over 330 schools across Australia.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>We are most successful in <span class = "bold">rural & regional areas </span> and populations that have a higher number of retirees.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>Our biggest strength is that our program is <span class = "bold"> low cost for both volunteers and schools.</span></p>
      </div>
    </div> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="stub"></div>
    <p>After this discussion we decided to focus the scope on the type of User that donates to NFP’s in order to contain the scope and ensure that we were able to achieve a MVP in our allotted time.  This was an important turning point as we had initially as a team discussed doing multiple User paths but after discussing with our Stakeholder and assessing our time available, decided that the most familiar and most needed update that the site needed was to their Donator User.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="stub"></div>
    <br>
    <p>We conducted 4 user interviews and 32 surveys to find out what was most important for users involved with a NFP.  The insights that we gauged from the data were analysed through a Affinity Map and the key insights from that process were:</p>
    <div class="tags">
      <div class="tag">
        <p><span class= "bold"> Transparency is important.</span> I want to see where my money is being spent before I make a considerable donation.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>I don't want to give away<span class = "bold">  too much personal information </span> when using online payment systems”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>“I don’t have time to volunteer due to work commitments. <span class="bold"> I prefer to make donations when I can”</span></p>

  <br>
  <p>In this situation we used the Competitor Analysis as a compare and comparison tool for this project and to help build inspiration for the uplift project.  We used local Australian NFP’s for comparison - <a url="https://thepyjamafoundation.com/">The Pyjama Foundation</a>, <a url="https://roop.org.au/">ROOP (Read out of Poverty)</a>, <a url = "https://www.thesmithfamily.com.au/">The Smith Family</a> and <a url= "https://dogsforkids.org.au/">Dogs for Kids.</a>  We performed a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Treats) analysis and from that our focus and inspiration developed was to uplift Story Dogs to have:</p>
  <ui class= "key-points-list">
    <li>Strong call-to-action button</li>
    <li>Clear contact information</li>
    <li>Shows impact of funding</li>
    <li>Precise mission statement</li>
    <li>Donation page that is with internal UI styling</li>

  <p>Through a red-lining process, we went through the donation process of the Story Dogs website and helped to identify pain points that we aimed to fix in this uplift.  In the end of the research process we had come to the conclusion that these were the key fixs the site needed:</p>
  <ui class= "key-points-list">
    <li>Improve site navigation system</li>
    <li>Implement a sitemap that works for all Users</li>

      </ui>
      <br>
      <div class="stub"></div>
      <p>Now that we had a lot of our research over, we began sketching out and defining further elements for the uplift.  We firstly focused on developing our User Persona which took the form of Marie Smith.</p>
        <div class ="image-wrapper">
          <img class= "card-image-large" src="..//portfolio/image/content/user_persona -storydogs.png">

        <br>
        <div class="stub"></div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>One of the elements that we didn’t have to update for this uplift was the User flow for the Donator User.  Whilst visually how the User followed that path was complicated and messy in its current state, the overall flow from the start of the task to the end was the same and consistent with what we would like in a NFP site regardless.  For that reason, we did not fix that User Flow, but rather clarified each of the steps involved in that process.</p>
        <div class ="image-wrapper">
          <img class= "card-image-large" src="..//portfolio/image/content/story-dogs-user flow.svg">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="stub"></div>
        <p>Discussing our MVP or Most Viable Product was an important moment in the development and design process for this project.  With only 3 weeks and once most of the research was done, only 1.5 weeks left to prototype and test defining this and assigning roles was critical for delivery.  Along with dividing our User to just focus on the Donator, breaking down how we would prototype and continue to develop was important.</p>

      </div>
      <div class = "right-card">
        <p>We ended up with 8 key pages or elements that our MVP needed to be successful:</p>
        <ui class= "key-points-list">
          <li>Homepage</li>
          <li>Top Navigation Design</li>
          <li>Donation Page</li>
          <li>Payment Page</li>
          <li>Success Page</li>
          <li>Sign Up Page</li>
          <li>Support Us Page</li>  
          <li>Universal Elements (Footer, Buttons, Forms etc).</li> 
      </ui><p>Once our MVP was decided on - I ended up picking up the Support Us Page and the Universal Elements portion which in conjunction with building one of the pages also focused on building a harmonious UI Style Guide for my team mates.  Prior to wireframing and further designing of the uplift, we did a thorough feature prioritization matrix to determine further what elements and features were needed for our MVP.</p>

      <p>Implementing a sitemap that works for all Users was a difficult challenge for our group as the original site map was complicated to say the least.  Our main focus was to condense and clarify the options that were available in their current state.  </p>
        <div class ="image-wrapper">
          <img class= "card-image-large" src="..//portfolio/image/content/updated sitemap.svg">
        </div>
      <p>Whilst we were able to implement a sitemap and IA for our MVP, post analysis on this after delivery we discussed as a team that this was one of the areas that we would like to further work on.  We wanted to ask more questions to our Stakeholders and understand further the needs for their Volunteers, Sponsorships and Media queries which we hadn’t really considered.  Our sitemap and its development is only really relevant for our MVP, further development on this project would require further revisions and updates.</p>

      <p>One of the simpler elements to the uplift project as a whole was the branding and styling choices our team had to make.  This was mostly due to the Instagram feed that the Stakeholders were developing and posting on a regular basis with. 
        <br>
        <br>
        During our discussions with the team at Story Dogs, they felt that it was easier for them to maintain their social media in comparison to their site.  Their engagement on Instagram is better and they felt that most of their Users are more comfortable connecting with them via Instagram than going through the website.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Due to this, we really focused on pulling a colour palette and stylization guide from the current way that they were providing content as that way they would blend well together in the future. </p>

  <p>Looking back on this part of the development, we spent a lot of time as a team critically analysing each other's work and mostly worked in very low fidelity.  This worked to help us flesh out complicated designs, however it doesn't look as pretty and doesn't really capture a lot of the conversations we had.  Conversations on what styling the ‘Donate’ button needed to be, why it had to be different from other buttons,what typography we wanted to focus on or conversations on the margin maintenance on each page.  Whilst not captured in each of the wireframes, I wish I had recorded our conversations as we went through each detail of each page together in every session we had together.

      <p>The most prominent iteration of our wireflows to our final prototype was the changes to our Payment and Sign Up Page.  Initially we started out with the concept that they needed to be separate and that the donation value could be determined before the payment page. We were inspired to do a multi-page Payment and Sign Up page in which the User would have smaller, easier to digest content.  </p>
      <br>
      <p>After workshopping and doing some small testing within our team, in conjunction with changes made to the Donation page, we decided to combine these into one traditional form.  Our response from testing reflected that this was a positive move as its layout was more familiar with our Users and therefore felt more trustworthy.</p>

    <p>The final prototype that we built is one of those projects that I will keep for a very long time, it has so many joyful moments in it and critical learning points that I can’t forget.  It has both its merits and faults and like anything can be improved on in the future.  I would like to focus on developing further User’s flows and getting more feedback on the current Final prototype to see what improvements can be made there.</p>

    <p>Story Dogs’ uplift was my first major project with a UI design focus that was done collaboratively and taking that into account I never realised how much compromising we all did as Designers on this project.  Nevertheless, the result is something I’m proud to showcase and learn from in the future.</p>
