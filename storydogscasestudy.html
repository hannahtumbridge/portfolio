        <p>A practical team project with 3 other members of the UX/UI Bootcamp I attended - focusing on a User Interface Design “uplift” for a local non-for-profit organization.  My team and I selected Story Dogs, an Australian NFP focused on improving the literacy skills of all children.

        <p>The Problem can be summarised into the simple statement: <span class= "bold">“The significance of the work done by the team at Story Dogs is weakened by the outdated design of the current website.” </span>
          <br>
          <br>
          From this we could extract several key elements that we felt like we could achieve within our time available for this project.  These were:

    <p>Our group approached our uplift project as a multi-step process.  The main focus was to achieve a worthy update to the site within our current timeframe of 3 weeks.  We broke down our process into 5 stages - Research, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test, however our flow through these stages wasn’t necessarily linear.  
      <br>
      <br>
      Whilst we did start with researching the User’s that we involved in the site and performing a heuristic evaluation -  we also focused on pulling together a style guide from their current social media branding or some beginning wireframes that were based off our competitor analysis.  
      <br>
      <br>
      Working in a team meant that we could sub-divide the work across multiple fronts and move quickly through it to ensure that we met our deadline and ensure that we didn't experience too much scope creep.

    <p>Reaching out to the team at Story Dogs and gaining their insight that helped bring our uplift project to another level.  Through several correspondences we discussed elements of their volunteers, their goals, sponsorship deals and how they wanted to grow in the future.  Due to the timeframe we knew we wouldn't be able to achieve all of the goals they had but focused on these major ones:</p> 
    <div class="tags">
      <div class="tag">
        <p>We would like the redesign to show how our organization has <span class = "bold"> impacted over 330 schools across Australia.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>We are most successful in <span class = "bold">rural & regional areas </span> and populations that have a higher number of retirees.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>Our biggest strength is that our program is <span class = "bold"> low cost for both volunteers and schools.</span></p>
      </div>
    </div> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="stub"></div>
    <p>After this discussion we decided to focus the scope on the type of User that donates to NFP’s in order to contain the scope and ensure that we were able to achieve a MVP in our allotted time.  This was an important turning point as we had initially as a team discussed doing multiple User paths but after discussing with our Stakeholder and assessing our time available, decided that the most familiar and most needed update that the site needed was to their Donator User.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="stub"></div>
    <br>
    <p>We conducted 4 user interviews and 32 surveys to find out what was most important for users involved with a NFP.  The insights that we gauged from the data were analysed through a Affinity Map and the key insights from that process were:</p>
    <div class="tags">
      <div class="tag">
        <p><span class= "bold"> Transparency is important.</span> I want to see where my money is being spent before I make a considerable donation.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>I don't want to give away<span class = "bold">  too much personal information </span> when using online payment systems”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tag">
        <p>“I don’t have time to volunteer due to work commitments. <span class="bold"> I prefer to make donations when I can”</span></p>

  <br>
  <p>In this situation we used the Competitor Analysis as a compare and comparison tool for this project and to help build inspiration for the uplift project.  We used local Australian NFP’s for comparison - <a url="https://thepyjamafoundation.com/">The Pyjama Foundation</a>, <a url="https://roop.org.au/">ROOP (Read out of Poverty)</a>, <a url = "https://www.thesmithfamily.com.au/">The Smith Family</a> and <a url= "https://dogsforkids.org.au/">Dogs for Kids.</a>  We performed a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Treats) analysis and from that our focus and inspiration developed was to uplift Story Dogs to have:</p>
  <ui class= "key-points-list">
    <li>Strong call-to-action button</li>
    <li>Clear contact information</li>
    <li>Shows impact of funding</li>
    <li>Precise mission statement</li>
    <li>Donation page that is with internal UI styling</li>
  </ui>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Through a red-lining process, we went through the donation process of the Story Dogs website and helped to identify pain points that we aimed to fix in this uplift.  In the end of the research process we had come to the conclusion that these were the key fixs the site needed:</p>
  <ui class= "key-points-list">
    <li>Improve site navigation system</li>
    <li>Implement a sitemap that works for all Users</li>
    <li>Fix inconsistent User Flows</li>

    <li>Improve colour accessibility</li>

        <p>Now that we had a lot of our research over, we began sketching out and defining further elements for the uplift.  We firstly focused on developing our User Persona which took the form of Marie Smith.</p>

        <br>
        <p>One of the elements that we didn’t have to update for this uplift was the User flow for the Donator User.  Whilst visually how the User followed that path was complicated and messy in its current state, the overall flow from the start of the task to the end was the same and consistent with what we would like in a NFP site regardless.  For that reason, we did not fix that User Flow, but rather clarified each of the steps involved in that process.</p>
